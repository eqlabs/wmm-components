title: Sending Wallet
---

Sending Wallet is a browser extension that adds the Web Monetization features into the browser and makes payments into the address defined by the website.

In practice this currently means the [Coil wallet extension](https://coil.com/).

Alternative you can use [Web Monetization Simulator](https://dev.to/gustavogr/web-monetization-simulator-dnc) to simulate wallet behaviour in the browser, without making actual payments.

Though note that most of the examples in **wmm-components** require the use of [receipt verifier](/docs/receipt-service), which is not possible with only browser simulation.
