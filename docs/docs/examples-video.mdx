First, startup the [streaming backend](/docs/examples-streaming). This is used by both video and audio examples. You can try out both by either choosing .mp4 file for video or .mp3 file for audio.

In this article we will look into WmmVideo Web Component in more detail.

TODO make urls work...


## Example

<div id="media-container">
(reload this page after starting the videoExample backend with the command above)
</div>


import {MediaImport} from './utils.js'

<MediaImport url="/wmm-components/examples/audioAndVideo/client.js" media="ElephantsDream.mp4"></MediaImport>

## Frontend

Import the web component from HTML:

```HTML
<script src="packages/wmm-web-components/videoComponent.js"
        type="module">
</script>
```

Or from JS:

```
import '/wmm-components/packages/wmm-web-components/videoComponent.js'
```


And insert it into a HTML page:

```
<wmm-video src="[video source url]"
           paymentURL="[recipe service url with payment pointer]">
</wmm-video>
```
