title: Receiving Wallet
---

You can setup a receiving wallet at [Uphold](https://webmonetization.org/docs/uphold) or [Gatehub](https://webmonetization.org/docs/gatehub).

Once you have a Payment Pointer address to your wallet, update its value into **paymentPointer** property in ```examples/audioAndVideo/config.js``` â€” or ```examples/text/config.js``` if your media is text.

Now when users access your website, their wallet extension will automatically make payments to your address!
